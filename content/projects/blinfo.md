{{% text %}}Visually impaired people can have a tough time navigating in buildings, which are unfamiliar to them. Blinfo was therefore developed in co-operation with Living IT Lab, to try to solve this problem. Through the app visually impaired people can receive push messages, with relevant information about the specific spot, they are currently at.{{% /text %}}

{{% text %}}The final platform consists of a CMS system and an iOS app. The Blinfo CMS was developed to easily create and change messages shown, at certain places around the building and the iOS app makes these messages available for users in the Blinfo app. In the CMS system messages can be attached to a certain spot in the building by the administrator. A series of settings can be set for each message, like which time a day the information should be shown.{{% /text %}}

{{% text %}}Above you can see a typical message received on their phone, when entering a building, in this specific instance a doctors office. The message is read aloud for the person using the app. If you swipe the push-message, additional information is provided.{{% /text %}}
