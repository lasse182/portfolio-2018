{{% text %}}The Nem Info platform consists of an iOS app and a content management system(CMS). Through the CMS system it is possible for administrators at public buildings to create an plan, when and where different messages should be presented for the user. It is possible to attach messages to specifik iBeacons and make a unique timetable for it. The Nem Info app makes sure that relevant information is provided, at the right place and time, for the citizens in the public building.{{% /text %}}
