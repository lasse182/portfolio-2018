{{% text %}}Shopper showcases a series of functionality, including browsing products, wishlist, filtering, 'You might Also like' and the current stock in stores. The app served as a great starting point for discussion of further development and possible functionality. Above you can see the homescreen and the overview of products. The homescreen leads you to a specific section, depending on what you are looking for. The overview of products, shows the mens section in Shopper.{{% /text %}}

{{% text %}}Filters provides a great way to filter the list of products to your liking and one of the 'extra' features of the app, was that it should hook up to stock data, and provide offline store availability right within the app. I was responsible for the complete project, including concept development, design and the interactive prototype.{{% /text %}}
